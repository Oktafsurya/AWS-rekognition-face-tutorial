# AWSSearchFaces
Demo showing how to use AWS Rekognition to search a private collection of faces for a match.

AWS Rekognition allows you to provide reference images of faces to compare new images against for a match.  So, 
for example, an employee's photo can be stored and then to allow them access, a picture is taken of their face and 
then their reference image is found to match.


## Steps for Searching for Faces in a Collection
1. Create the collection
2. Add images to the collection
3. Search the collection for a matching face
